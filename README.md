# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description
I created a simple, yet clearly orgainzed webpage, to better help me (and possily others) perform and learn in and out of class. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript elements as ell as basic Gitbash, Github functions I was able overcome my fear of the overwhelming infromation you are handed when learning how to code.
In the process I not only learned a lot about basic web development but also gained a lot of confidence in a new set of skills I did previously have.
